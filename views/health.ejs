              <strong>Medical treatments:</strong><br>
              Scientists around the world are working to find and develop treatments for COVID-19.
              Optimal supportive care includes oxygen for severely ill patients and those who are at risk for severe disease and more advanced respiratory support such as ventilation for patients who are critically ill.
              Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that can help reduce the length of time on a ventilator and save lives of patients with severe and critical illness.
              WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19.
